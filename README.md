# AT2 RPG Game

RPG game featuring much funny stuff.

Features:
- A healthbar (no way bro)
- Some weapons and skills (probably)
- Some very high quality graphics that rival those of roblox squid game, but are definitely very ergonomic (because I need marks)
- A lot of fun bosses that hopefully will mean you don't return this game on the steam library :(((

"This is a very good game I totally recommend it" - William Liu (unbiased source)
